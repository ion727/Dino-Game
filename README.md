# Dino-Game
## Description
Training a neural network to beat the dino game.
Programmed a rough Pygame replica of the Dino Game, then trained the bots with my pynn module. 

## Functional Save File:
`save2.txt` is currently the best neural network; to use it change line 10 in main.py to `LOAD_FILE = "save2.txt"` and line 11 to either `SAVE_FILE = None` or `SAVE_FILE = "save2.txt"`
